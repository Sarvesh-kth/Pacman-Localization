# Pacman-Localization

The jupyter files contains a particle filter localization for code for pacman along with tracking multiple agents, that are the ghosts. A motion model based on pacman objective to run away from ghosts and ghosts objective to eat Pacman was the basis. Scenarios such as kidnapping and teleporation were considered and the algorithm was made to be robust against it. Run all in jupyter notebook and escape to close the video.
